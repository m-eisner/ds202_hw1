### Matthew Eisner: m-eisner ###
In the most recent commit, Matthew put his hw1 html and rmd files and called it *initial hw1 commit*. Encountered an **error** because the image in his rmd file is not present. The biggest thing that has helped my understanding git is just thinking of it as a different place to put things that is accessible by more people. Its basically a new bin.
